Making a zone from the ground up is hard, especially if you're doing it on your own. Thankfully, throughout the years Blizzard has given us various peeks at their zone design process (sometimes intentional and sometimes not). I wanted to write up this post to document what (to me) appears to be their process in the hopes some of it could be useful for artists wanting to make stuff or learn/take inspiration based on how Blizzard does it. I'm a huge fan of this entire process and all the steps that go into it, so expect a long post.

Note that while these steps are described one by one for readability, in reality these likely overlap a lot with multiple of them starting at the same time or being revisited throughout the process. I will try to show/link to examples of the things I mention in each part for the visual learners (like myself).

## Initial concepts
When starting work on an expansion, the narrative team works on the overarching story concept and I assume soon after basic descriptions/keywords of the zones are written down, concept artists (the "Visual Development" team) start working on rough sketches based on those ideas to start fleshing out the colors, biomes and themes of a zone.

## Asset creation
After the themes start solidifying the "Visual Development" team continues to flesh out and make concept art for foliage, doodad kits, buildings etc for the various inhabitants of a zone based on this art.

- (Building kit concepts) 11.0 [Arathi Architecture](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/K3Od0B) by David Noren

Based on those concepts, artists start working on buildings, props, foliage and other doodads. Texture artists will start working on terrain textures.

## Demo zones
With zone concepts and the first rough assets rolling in, exterior designers will start to make demo zones or 'dioramas' using the assets they have to get a feel for the zone.

## Layout
The exterior design team, likely in collaboration with the quest designers etc will start making rough 2D maps of the zone in e.g. Adobe Illustrator with to give an idea of the basic layout and scale of the zone (optionally with a grid overlay per ADT, or what Blizz calls them, "world chunks", to get a good indication for scale) and then a more detailed map with more roads, POIs and sometimes even basic terrain colors for the various biomes. 

Some designers might prefer blocking out in 3D instead, but historically Blizzard prefers and internally recommends 2D concepting first as those maps are easier to share between the teams (as per Cory Stockton during his Game Design Expo talk linked below).

## Rough sculpting/blockout
### 2D map printing
In recent years, we've noticed that Blizzard sometimes appears to start out by just 'printing' the 2D layout maps onto terrain, and then sculpting it from there on out. 

Printed maps:

- tww devmap: https://old.wow.tools/pub/mapv1.png

Blockouts:

- nazjatar (nzoth) pre 2d-printed terrain maps (colored zoning?) https://map.wow.tools/?map=NZoth&v=798&z=6&lat=-34.594&lng=39.891

### Earlier zone blockout methods
Before that, Blizzard appeared to roughly draw out the various subzones (sometimes up to a biome level) with some very basic terrain geometry and sometimes colors. I'm guessing there were various different methods they could follow.

## Kit placement
Exterior designers usually make spots on maps or related maps that have the kit for a certain zone/race that they'll be using throughout the map. 

Some uses like making it easy to copy/paste assets from the kit into the map seem obvious, but it's possibly also during asset development to keep an eye on what is finished/not or what needs cutting if it ended up being unused (as can be seen in the examples below).

## Zone verification
According to Cory Stockton's 2011 Game Design Expo talk, when (part of) a zone is handed off by a designer, they render a top-down 2D compiled minimap image (as there are a few examples of in this post) and put the 2D map on top of it to verify that this is indeed the right size, has the right POIs and everything that was agreed upon earlier. 

Whether or not this is still done in their current design process I don't know (given they can stamp the 2D maps on terrain now and build on top of that).

## Case Study: Nazjatar 
Nazjatar is a map we have a particularly interesting iterations of. It does not follow all of the same modern design processes that they currently seem to (no printable 2D maps for one), but it's still interesting to look at.

I've credited all the artists where I could but credits obviously also go out to the various teams at Blizzard that work on/help with any of these processes.
