Making a zone from the ground up is hard, especially if you're doing it on your own. Thankfully, throughout the years Blizzard has given us various peeks at their zone design process (sometimes intentional and sometimes not). I wanted to write up this post to document what (to me) appears to be their process in the hopes some of it could be useful for artists wanting to make stuff or learn/take inspiration based on how Blizzard does it. I'm a huge fan of this entire process and all the steps that go into it, so expect a long post.

Note that while these steps are described one by one for readability, in reality these likely overlap a lot with multiple of them starting at the same time or being revisited throughout the process. I will try to show/link to examples of the things I mention in each part for the visual learners (like myself).

## Initial concepts
When starting work on an expansion, the narrative team works on the overarching story concept and I assume soon after basic descriptions/keywords of the zones are written down, concept artists (the "Visual Development" team) start working on rough sketches based on those ideas to start fleshing out the colors, biomes and themes of a zone.

- (11.0) [Isle of Dorn Concepts](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/OvmRkb) by David Noren

## Asset creation
After the themes start solidifying the "Visual Development" team continues to flesh out and make concept art for foliage, doodad kits, buildings etc for the various inhabitants of a zone based on this art.

- (Building kit concepts) 11.0 [Arathi Architecture](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/K3Od0B) by David Noren

Based on those concepts, artists start working on buildings, props, foliage and other doodads. Texture artists will start working on terrain textures.

## Demo zones
With zone concepts and the first rough assets rolling in, exterior designers will start to make demo zones or 'dioramas' using the assets they have to get a feel for the zone.

## Layout
The exterior design team, likely in collaboration with the quest designers etc will start making rough 2D maps of the area with a rough sketch first and then a more detailed map with a grid overlay per ADT to get a size indication.

## Rough sculpting/blockout
In recent years, we've noticed that Blizzard sometimes appears to start out by just 'printing' the 2D layout maps onto terrain, and then sculpting it from there on out.
