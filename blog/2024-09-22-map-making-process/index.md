Making a zone from the ground up is hard, especially if you're doing it on your own. Through the years Blizzard has given us various peeks at their map making process (sometimes intentional and sometimes not). I wanted to write up this post to document what (to me) appears to be their map making process and how some of it is useful even to non-Blizzard mappers.

### Planning
#### Idea/concept
Obviously they start out with a general idea from the story team. I'm guessing they get a relatively rough size/map of the entire continent and a general idea of the major POIs. The concept art team will have made concept art of the zones and other teams will have made terrain textures and kits for the various inhabitants of a zone. Community mappers usually rely on existing textures and kits, but everything else is up for grabs. I personally just start messing around with a basic idea as I'm not super creative. Whatever works for you to get started.

#### Demo zones
With the assets that have been made and rough idea, some designers make little 'dioramas' using these assets to get a feel for the zone.

#### Layout
The exterior design team will start making rough 2D maps of the area with a rough sketch first and then a more detailed map with a grid overlay per ADT to get a size indication.

### Rough sculpting/blockout
In recent years, we've noticed that Blizzard sometimes appears to start out by just 'printing' the 2D layout maps onto terrain, and then sculpting it from there on out.

#### 10.2 Emerald Dream developer map
[10.2 Emerald Dream developer map exploration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hic1FXto3fE), this video by Dovah shows off a lot of their various processes and is relatively recent. This dev map is also shown off in this officially released [Building Azeroth episode](https://x.com/Warcraft/status/1727024280666251772).
