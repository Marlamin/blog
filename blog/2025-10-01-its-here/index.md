A short but needed blog post.

In today's [Midnight Deep Dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmG98apVwKw), Blizzard introduced us to "The Arcantina", the model of which is based on the Hearthstone Tavern interior model.

Yes, the Hearthstone Tavern model I've mentioned [many times before](/wow-wishlist/#hearthstone-tavern), even [while on the Community Council](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/dont-let-the-unused-hearthstone-tavern-model-go-to-waste/1396364) AND [modded a whole exterior for](/the-tavern/) *(see those posts for some history on the tavern model both from the game and in canon outside of it)*.

This means the tavern "far away from her *(Xal'atath)* reach" ([#1](https://marlam.in/u/pyemlxxuPy.png), [#2](https://marlam.in/u/iiR6SLtC7i.png)) from the [Seasons comic](https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/template_resource/TEFHLG7PQIL41734383405326.pdf) was what we now know to be the Arcantina. 

With it now being a 'story hub', my battle for its use in the game is over. Thank you, Blizzard.

That said, 2025 isn't over yet.
